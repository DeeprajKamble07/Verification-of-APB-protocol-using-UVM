# Verification-of-APB-protocol-using-UVM

The Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) is part of the AMBA protocol family and is primarily used for low-bandwidth, low-power peripheral communication within SoC designs. APB provides a simple, non-pipelined interface with signals such as PSEL, PENABLE, PWRITE, PADDR, PWDATA, PRDATA, and PREADY. A transfer consists of two phases: the Setup phase (where address and control signals are asserted) and the Enable phase (where data transfer occurs). Due to its simple handshake-based architecture, APB is commonly used for connecting peripherals like UART, GPIO, timers, and interrupt controllers.

This project focuses on verifying an APB slave interface using SystemVerilog with a modular testbench architecture consisting of generator, driver, monitor, reference model, and scoreboard. The verification environment validates correct read and write transactions, proper handshake timing between PSEL, PENABLE, and PREADY, and accurate data transfer behavior. Directed and randomized test cases were developed to test normal operation, back-to-back transfers, wait-state insertion, and protocol violations. Assertions and functional coverage were included to ensure protocol compliance and achieve comprehensive verification closure.
